// The DOM
// const img = document.getElementById("img"); // TS infers that img is an html element, but it also can be null

// const myImg = document.querySelector("img"); // now TS sees that we're being more specific and infers the HTMLImageElement type (or null, again)
const img = document.querySelector("img")!; // We know for sure that we added an <img /> in our HTML, which TS has no idea about, and this is where assertion is very handy; we know better than TypeScript what type this value is

const myImg = document.getElementById("img") as HTMLImageElement;
const nextImg = <HTMLImageElement>document.getElementById("img");

// img.src;
// myImg.src; // two problems here: 1) myImg is possibly null; 2) property "src" does not exist on HTMLElement
// To convince TS that we know for sure this is not null, we can put "!" at the end of assignment; this is called NON NULL ASSERTION

// It makes sense to use non null assertion for img instead since TS already infered that it's HTMLImageElement, and all we need to do is to tell TS that it's not null
// On the other hand, we don't have to use both "!" and "as ..." on myImg, since "as ..." implies that this has a specific type
